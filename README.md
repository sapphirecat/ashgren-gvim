# ashgren-vim

A muted, mid-tone color scheme for GVim.

# Demo

Coming soon.

# History

This is based on an ancient PuTTY theme, created as an experiment around some
usability issues with the default theme:

1. Blue-on-black was both common, and difficult to read
2. Vim used `background=light` but the background was black
3. It is difficult to distinguish dark colors on a white background

Ashgren discarded white for an “ash green” background, and built from there.
