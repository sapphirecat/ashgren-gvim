## VS Code

The [Daobeam](https://vscodethemes.com/e/mike-flanigan.Daobeam)
theme matches the ashgren idea fairly well.
I'm not really interested in writing a VS Code theme myself.

# History

This is based on an ancient PuTTY theme, created as an experiment around some
usability issues with the default theme:

1. Blue-on-black was both common, and difficult to read
2. Vim used `background=light` but the background was black
3. It is difficult to distinguish dark colors on a white background

Ashgren discarded white for an “ash green” background, and built from there.
